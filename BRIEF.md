- **Today, 2:15pm:** We handle KYC, compliance, currency conversion
- **Tomorrow, 10am:** Money lands in 242 countries, local currency / *(No SWIFT limbo. No bank interrogations.)*
- **Tomorrow, 11am:** Audit trail auto-generated. One B2B invoice for your books.
- **Final box:** "You: Back to building your product."

**CTA below:** Secondary button "Pay Your First Person"

### Section 5: Comparison Table

**Header:** "You have three options. Two of them waste your life."

**Three-column comparison table:**
- Columns: "Keep DIY-ing It" | "Better Payroll Tool" | "Stape"
- Rows:
  - 6 hours every payroll cycle | 2 hours configuring | ✅ 6 minutes total
  - You learn tax law | You learn their system | ✅ You learn nothing
  - You own all the risk | You still own the risk | ✅ We own the risk
  - Excel + Wise + crypto + hope | Their dashboard + 5 integrations | ✅ One click
  - "Where's my payment?" DMs | "How do I...?" tickets | ✅ Radio silence (the good kind)
- Use ❌, ⚠️, ✅ symbols

**Tagline below table:** "We're not a better mousetrap. We're making mice irrelevant."

### Section 6: Role-Specific Outcomes (Tabs or Accordion)

**Header:** "What actually changes"

**Four expandable tabs:** For Founders | For CFOs | For Hiring Managers | For HR Managers

**Content examples:**

**For Founders:**
- "You stop being an unlicensed accountant. Your Saturdays are yours. When someone asks 'how do you handle payroll?' you say 'I don't' — and mean it as a good thing."

**For CFOs:**
- "You stop explaining payment delays. You stop reconciling exceptions. You stop briefing accountants. You get one B2B invoice. You get audit trails. You get your Fridays back."

**For Hiring Managers:**
- "You stop being a payment processor. You stop answering 'where's my money?' DMs. You stop Googling tax codes. You click 'Pay Everyone' and move on."

**For HR Managers:**
- "You stop chasing documents. You stop explaining delays. You stop being the bottleneck. You get compliant payments in 242 countries without becoming a tax expert."

**CTA per tab:** "See How This Works For Me"

### Section 7: FAQ (Accordion)

**Header:** "The questions keeping you from clicking that button"

**5 questions as expandable accordions:**

1. **"What if Stape gets sanctioned or shut down?"**
   - Answer: "We're built on multiple payment rails across multiple jurisdictions. If one path closes, others stay open. Your contractors get paid. Always."

2. **"How is this different from just using Deel?"**
   - Answer: "Deel is an EOR (employer of record). We're payroll-only. You keep your contractors as contractors. You pay them. We handle the complexity. No entity setup. No waiting."

3. **"Sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?"**
   - Answer: "The catch is you pay €50 per payout. That's it. No setup fees. No monthly minimums. No hidden costs. If you're paying 10 contractors monthly, that's €500/month. Compare that to your current time cost."

4. **"What if my contractor needs documents for a visa?"**
   - Answer: "We generate compliance documents automatically. Tax forms, payment receipts, proof of income — all generated per transaction. Your contractor gets what they need, when they need it."

5. **"How long does this actually take to set up?"**
   - Answer: "First payment: 48 hours. Full roster: depends on how fast you upload your list. Most teams are paying everyone within 2 cycles. Not because we pressured them, but because they stopped thinking about payroll."

### Section 9: Final CTA (Commitment Reducer)

**Header:** "You don't have to switch everything today"

**Subhead:** "Pay one contractor through Stape this month. See how it feels. If it works, pay two next month. We're not trying to own your soul — we're trying to save your Saturdays."

**Two CTAs side by side:**
- Primary (lime): "Pay One Person Today"
- Secondary (outline): "Talk to a Human First"

## Design Principles

- **White space is sacred** — 80–120px padding between sections
- **Typography hierarchy is critical** — dramatic size jumps (72px → 24px → 16px)
- **Use parenthetical asides** in lighter weight or italics to reduce anxiety
- **Smooth scroll interactions** — subtle fade-ins on scroll
- **Clean borders** — 1px light gray dividers between sections
- **Button style:** Rounded corners (8px), generous padding (16px 32px), subtle hover states
- **Tables:** Clean lines, adequate cell padding, alternating row backgrounds
- **Cards:** Subtle shadows (0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)), white background

## Anti-Patterns (Do Not Use)

- Purple/pink gradients, floating orbs
- Generic fonts (Space Grotesk)
- Multiple competing CTAs
- Flat backgrounds without atmosphere
- Corporate jargon ("revolutionary", "best-in-class")
